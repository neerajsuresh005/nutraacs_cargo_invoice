# Ledger Mapping Implementation Validation

## Overview
This document validates the implementation of ledger mapping functionality for the Cargo AWB Invoice Module as requested by the user.

## Requirements Validation

### 1. Charge Master Module
- [x] Added ledger mapping field for 'supplier' and 'income' type charges
- [x] Implemented conditional display logic based on charge type
- [x] Added appropriate validation for required fields
- [x] Ensured ledgerId is saved with charge definition
- [x] Added helper text explaining the purpose of ledger mapping

### 2. Invoice Module - Agent Charges Section
- [x] Added ledger column to the charges table
- [x] Implemented conditional display of ledger selection based on charge type
- [x] Ensured ledger mapping is preserved when charges are added from master
- [x] Allowed override of default ledger mapping in the invoice context

### 3. Data Flow
- [x] Verified ledgerId is properly stored in the charge definition
- [x] Confirmed ledger mapping is transferred to invoice charges
- [x] Ensured updates to ledger mapping in invoice don't affect master definitions
- [x] Validated that the UI clearly indicates mapped vs. unmapped charges

### 4. User Interface
- [x] Created dedicated OtherChargeMaster component for bulk ledger mapping
- [x] Implemented filtering of ledgers based on charge type
- [x] Added clear visual indicators for mapping status
- [x] Ensured consistent UI patterns across all components

## Mock Data
- [x] Created comprehensive mock ledger data with appropriate types
- [x] Ensured ledger types align with charge types (income/supplier)

## Edge Cases
- [x] Handled scenario where charge type changes after ledger is mapped
- [x] Managed empty/null ledger mappings gracefully
- [x] Ensured proper validation when saving mappings

## Conclusion
The implementation successfully meets all requirements for adding ledger mapping functionality to the Cargo AWB Invoice Module. The UI is intuitive, data flow is consistent, and all edge cases have been handled appropriately.
